**Total (4% of your final grade)**

**Instructions for the Referee:**

Submit as two separate PDF your feedback to the draft project reports that you reviewed. Your feedback should include feedback based on the Grading Rubric [here](project_report_grading_rubric).

1. For each section of the grading rubric, write a few sentences about the state of the report and where it can be improved. Your feedback should be about 3 separate paragraphs long. 
2. Create a new and separate PDF for the other report you give feedback on. 
3. Email separately the author your feedback only for their report. 
4. Submit both PDFs to D2L to be graded when finished.
