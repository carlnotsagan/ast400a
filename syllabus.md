#ASTR 400A: Theoretical Astrophysics - Fall 2025


# Description of the course 

The main topic of the course is stellar structure, a field of astronomy
that brings together many different branches of physics (hydrodynamics,
atomic, nuclear, and neutrino physics, radiation-matter interactions,
etc.) to understand the fundamental objects of astronomical study:
stars.

See also [here](./schedule.md) for a breakdown of the main topics
covered and
[here](./assignments/projects.md) for a
tentative list of topics covered by student presentations.

# Expected learning outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

-   **Understand the physical scales associated with a wide variety of
    astronomical objects and phenomena.**
-   **Apply a physically motivated theoretical framework to stellar
    structure to derive stellar properties and compare to
    observations.**
-   **Use mathematical and computational skills to solve astrophysical
    problems related to stars and more generally astrophysics.**
-   **Communicating, translating, and interpreting fundamental
    astronomical concepts and research results.**
-   **Distinguish observationally confirmed elements of stellar physics
    from numerical results.**

These learning outcomes will be met through attendance at lectures,
in-class activities, homework and writing assignments, and a final
literature review project made of written and oral presentation on a
selected topic. See [Projects](./assignments/projects.org) for more information,
including a list of possible topics.

# Course format and teaching methods

This course relies on frontal lectures, homework, and in-class problem
solving activities (individual and in group), and student presentations.
Some problem solving activities will be of computational nature.

This is also a class with \"writing emphasis\", which will be included
as part of homework and the final presentation.

# Recommended textbooks and resources

Most stellar physics text books will contain most of the information
covered in this course, although order and presentation vary. You can
use any textbook you like or already have. I recommend and will mostly
follow these:

-   [Prof. Onno Pols notes](https://www.astro.ru.nl/~onnop/). These
    lecture notes are freely available, accessible, and thorough, making
    them an excellent starting point. I strongly suggest downloading a
    copy for yourself early in the course.
-   [Kippenhahn, Weigert, & Weiss
    2012](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-30304-3).
    This is a classic textbook that you may continue to consult even as
    a seasoned researcher with emphasis on the physical processes in
    stars. If you are an enrolled student and have troubles accessing
    this book, please come talk to me.

We will also use
[MESA-web](http://user.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=mesa-web-submit),
a cloud-computing resource to run stellar evolution simulations with the
open-source, community-developed, code
[MESA](https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/).

# Exams and grading

The course grade will be based on:

-   In class participation/activities: 30%
-   Homework: 30%
-   Literature review project/presentation (written+oral): 40%

The class will not be curved, and this will be the correspondence
between final percentages and letter grades:

-   A: 85-100%
-   B: 70-85%
-   C: 50-70%
-   D: 30-50%
-   E: 0-30%

## Participation

Your engagement, quality of contributions, and interactions with the
instructors and with your peers will contribute to your final grade.
Quality and frequency of your contributions will be evaluated throughout
the course, rewarding specifically **growth** and **improvement**.

Participation will take many forms during the course to include in-class activites, pre-class assignments (PCAs), or group problem solving in-class. 

## Homework

There will be regular homework assignments, including
order-of-magnitude, quantitative, computational and/or more qualitative
exercises, depending on the week and topic. Please feel free to use
resources outside of the textbook. You can also collaborate with your
peers, but please **each time you do, indicate with whom**. You **must**
show your individual work to receive full credit.

Assignments should be uploaded **in pdf form** via D2L. Deadlines will
be designed to use the homework materials in class. **Late submissions
will not be accepted unless explicitly agreed upon beforehand**, if you
expect not to make it on time, ask for an extension **at least one day
before the deadline**. It's better to submit something incomplete than
nothing. In your pdf files, you should show the calculations done and
contextualise them as appropriate.

Timely feedback will be provided for you to assess your understanding
and progress.

## Literature review project and presentation

You will be assigned a topic relevant to the course to explain to your
peers. You will search the literature and prepare a written text plus an
oral presentation. The written text will be evaluated both by the
instructor and two randomly selected peers, the oral presentation will
be evaluated by all the student present plus the instructors. For more
information on the literature review project/presentation and how it
will be graded, see [here](./assignments/projects.org).

# Statement on Generative AI
In this course any and all uses of generative artificial intelligence (AI)/large language model tools such as ChatGPT, Dall-e, Google Bard, Microsoft Bing, etc. will be considered a violation of the Code of Academic Integrity, specifically the prohibition against submitting work that is not your own. This applies to all assessments in the course, including case studies, written assignments, discussions, quizzes, exams, and problem sets. This course policy is driven by the learning goals and desired learning outcomes for the course described above. 

The following actions are **prohibited**: 

 - entering all or any part of an assignment statement or test questions as part of a prompt to a large language model AI tool;
 - incorporating any part of an AI-written response in an assignment;
 - using AI to summarize or contextualize reading assignments or source materials; and
 - submitting your own work for this class to a large language model AI tool for iteration or improvement.

## Incomplete (I) or Withdrawal (W):

Requests for incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W) must be made in accordance
with University policies, which are available at
<https://registrar.arizona.edu/faculty-staff-resources/grading/grading-policies/incomplete>
and
<https://registrar.arizona.edu/faculty-staff-resources/grading/grading-policies/withdrawals>,
respectively.

# Classroom Behavior

To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors have
a shared responsibility. We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive
environment where all of us feel comfortable with each other and where
we can challenge ourselves to succeed. To that end, our focus is on the
tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting, chatting,
web surfing, etc.). Students are asked to refrain from disruptive
conversations with people sitting around them during lecture. Students
observed engaging in disruptive activity will be asked to cease this
behavior. Those who continue to disrupt the class will be asked to leave
lecture or discussion and may be reported to the Dean of Students.

The Arizona Board of Regents' Student Code of Conduct, ABOR Policy
5‐308, prohibits threats of physical harm to any member of the
University community, including to one's self. See:
[http://policy.web.arizona.edu/threatening‐behavior‐students](http://policy.web.arizona.edu/threatening‐behavior‐students)

Any social media groups generated using university-sponsored tools
(e.g., D2L class lists, slack workspaces) should be treated as an
extension of the classroom. This means that they will need to abide by
the University's student code of conduct policies, and be respectful,
inclusive environments.

## Nondiscrimination and Anti-harassment Policy

The University of Arizona is committed to creating and maintaining an
environment free of discrimination. In support of this commitment, the
University prohibits discrimination, including harassment and
retaliation, based on a protected classification, including race, color,
religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual
orientation, gender identity, or genetic information. For more
information, including how to report a concern, please see
<http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy>

## Accessibility and accommodations

At the University of Arizona, we strive to make learning experiences as
accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience barriers based
on disability or pregnancy, please contact the Disability Resource
Center (520-621-3268, <https://drc.arizona.edu/>) to establish
reasonable accommodations.

## Class recordings

To facilitate everyone\'s participation, audio and/or video recording of
in class activities is not allowed unless explicitly agreed upon by all
present students *and* instructors. In no case sharing on public
platforms of the recordings will be allowed.

## Preferred Name and Pronouns

This course affirms people of all gender expressions and gender
identities. If you prefer to be called a different name than what is on
the class roster, please let me know. Feel free to correct instructors
on your preferred gender pronoun.

# Attendance Policy

All holidays or special events observed by organized religions will be
honored for those students who show affiliation with that particular
religion. Absences pre‐approved by the UA Dean of Students (or Dean\'s
designee) will be honored.

It is important to attend all classes, as what is discussed in class is
pertinent to adequate performance on assignments and exams. If you must
be absent, it is your responsibility to obtain and review the
information you missed.



# Academic Integrity

Integrity is expected of every student in all academic work. The guiding
principle of academic integrity is that a student's submitted work must
be the student's own. Students are encouraged to share intellectual
views and discuss freely the principles and applications of course
materials. However, **graded work/exercises must be the product of your
own effort unless otherwise instructed**. Students are expected to
adhere to the UA Code of Academic Integrity as described in the UA
General Catalog. See:
<https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/student-rights-responsibilities/academic-integrity>

Misappropriation of exams before or after they are given will be
considered academic misconduct. Misconduct of any kind will be
prosecuted and may result in any or all of the following:

-   Reduction of grade
-   Failing grade
-   Referral to the Dean of Students for consideration of additional
    penalty, i.e. notation on a student's transcript re. academic
    integrity violation, etc.
