# ASTR 400A: Theoretical Astrophysics, Fall 2025, University of Arizona, Steward Observatory


Online course website for [ASTR 400A: Theoretical Astrophysics](https://catalog.arizona.edu/courses/0088341) - Fall 2025 taught by [@carlnotsagan](https://carlnotsagan.github.io/) at University of Arizona, Department of Astronomy and Steward Observatory. 

This website will serve as a homepage for course materials including lectures, schedules, additional learning materials, assignments, and various examples. 


## Learning Objectives 

**ASTR 400** - _The theory of stellar structure and evolution, star formation, and planet formation._

* Understand the physical scales associated with a wide variety of astronomical objects and phenomena.
* Apply a physically motivated theoretical framework to stellar structure to derive stellar properties and compare to observations.
* Use mathematical and computational skills to solve astrophysical problems related to stars and more generally astrophysics.
* Communicating, translating, and interpreting fundamental astronomical concepts and research results.
* Distinguish observationally confirmed elements of stellar physics from numerical results.    


## Getting Started

Below are some details about getting started with some of the tools and resources we will be using throughout the semester.

### Conda programming environment

Throughout this course we will be using various python tools and packages. [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) is a package manager that allows you to create environments for downloading all the packages you need without disrupting (usually) the existing computing `env` you are using. 

Please download the appropriate `conda` environment for your machine, create an environment for this class, and install a few starting packages including:

```
conda install anaconda::jupyter
```

### Slack

There is a slack workspace for this course, let me know if you did not receive an invite! 

### Jupyter Notebooks

In this course, we will use Jupyter Notebooks for various in-class activities. Please visit here to learn about installing a [Jupyter Notebook Interface](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html). You can use `conda` if you already have it installed! Also, if you have not worked with Jupyter Notebooks before, visit this tutorial on launching and running [Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html).
