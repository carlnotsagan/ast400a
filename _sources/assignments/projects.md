# Literature review project and presentation

The aim of this literature review project is for each student to engage
in a bit more depth with an important topic in modern stellar physics
*and* explain it to the rest of the class. This is effectively a
literature review + exposition project, you are *not* expected to
produce new results, but you should aim at digesting and being able to
explain the context, physical processes at play, and how they relate to
the material seen in class (during lectures, activities, and other
student presentations!).

**N.B.:** The aim of the project is for you to focus on the *physical
processes* that are relevant and to put them in the context of the
course material to explain the rest of the class something.

Each student will be assigned a topic to research from the list below
and provide a short written summary ( ≤ 5 pages including figures and/or
tables and references) and an oral presentation to the classroom. This
will allow each student to dig deeper into a topic we cannot spend too
much time on in class, and at the same we can all learn from each other!

> It is **strongly** encouraged that the written summary be prepared using `LaTeX` via tools such as Overleaf, MacTeX, or other and exported as a final PDF. AAS Journals also provide templates examples [here](https://journals.aas.org/aastex-package-for-manuscript-preparation/). PDF produced using Microsoft Word will also be accepted. 

The **oral presentation is 10min+5min questions**. 

## Timeline

-   **November 11, 2025, end of day**: submission of draft manuscript to
    peer-referees via email
-   **November 18, 2025, end of day**: referees submit feedback
-   **December 4, 2025, end of day**: submission of final manuscript to D2L
    
    

All files should be exchanged **in pdf** format, via email copying the
instructor. To make sure that your peers have time to read, provide
feedback, and incorporate that feedback, please adhere strictly to this
timeline. Any deviations need to be agreed upon by all parties.

## Procedure to assign projects

Each student will be asked identify 5 topics of interest from the list
below, and I will assign the research topic and the peer referees from
these lists. It may not be possible to satisfy each student's
preferences.

38. Something else within the scope of the course (**to be agreed
    upon**!)
39. Combination of topics above (**to be agreed upon**!)

## Recommended sources

You are encouraged to do your own research, but in the final manuscript
(and when appropriate in the oral presentation) you need to cite all the
relevant sources. These can be textbooks, review papers, and/or journal
articles. To find journal articles, you can use
[NASA/ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/). You can use online
freely-available resources (e.g., Wikipedia) as a starting point, but
should go find *primary* sources (e.g., what Wikipedia itself cites, if
not the references cited by the source from Wikipedia, and so on...).

## Grading

*This part is worth 40% of your final grade -- almost as much as all the
homework combined, so you want to do it well!*

Both text and presentations will be evaluated by the instructors *and*
your peers according to the evaluation rubrics outlined below.

More specifically, the text will be evaluated by two other students in
the class, while the oral presentation and handling of the questions
will be evaluated by all the students present. Your presence and active
participation in the presentation from other students is required and
will be counted towards the general in-class participation.

All students will be encouraged to ask questions during the
presentations. The questions and the way you provide your evaluations
and feedback to your peers will also be considered for your final
grading.

The breakdown of the project/presentation grade is as follows:

-   50% for the oral presentation and QA (corresponding to 20% of the
    total final grade)
-   40% for the written report (corresponding to 16% of the total final
    grade)
-   10% from how you provide feedback to others (corresponding to 4% of
    the total final grade).

**N.B.**: Regardless of the quantitative weight of each portion towards
the grade, your engagement is necessary for the success of the others.
When refereeing your feedback should help them improve, and nobody wants
to present to an absent audience!

Remember to appreciate the time and effort others have put in their work
and be kind and constructive in providing feedback. The aim is to learn
and improve, not to crush other people\'s work. And also, nothing is
ever perfect, there is always something to be asked and/or something
that can be improved!


# Honors project

To get honors credits for this class, on top of the project described
above, you will do a stellar evolution theory project using the
[MESA](https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/) code on your own laptop to
investigate in more depth some aspect that we will only barely mention
in class. [Follow this link to see an example honors
project](./honors.md).
