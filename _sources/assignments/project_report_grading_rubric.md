# Grading Scheme - Literature review project


Due Thursday, Dec. 4, 2025 | **Total 16 points (16% of Final Grade)**

**Project Report (3-5 pages, single column)**

_can be less pages if double column using `AASTeX`_

**Total: (16 points)**

Submit a 3-5 page PDF, prepared using LaTeX or Markdown, or other describing the astrophysical phenomena explored, its relevance to the topics in this class, and optionally any key results this topic has had recently. 

Sections could include: introduction or background, significance in stellar astrophysics, recent results, broader impacts on astronomy, summary. 

Figures should be PDF or png if using PgStar. Cite appropriate references using citation packages such as BibTex and / or the [astrophysics data system](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/). Citation to software packages used should also be included. 

## Grading of the Final Written Report

### Scientific depth


**Exceptional (4-6) points**: The (astro)physics is clearly explained in a concise but insightful way. The topic is appropriately unwrapped and connected to the broader context. Qualitative and quantitative aspects are clearly addressed and put in context. 

**Very Good (3-4) points**: The (astro)physics is explained in a clear way and context is provided. Quantitative and qualitative aspects are discussed in an understandable fashion.

**Adequate (2-3) points**: The (astro)physics is explained but the presentation could be clearer. Small gaps in the quantitative and/or qualitative aspects can be identified. 

**Fair (0-2) points**: The (astro)physics is not explained or the explanation is incorrect. Quantitative and/or qualitative errors are present,   


### Content logic and readability


**Exceptional (4-5) points**: The scope of the topic is clearly stated. The report builds up clearly and progressively, in an easy to follow and logical way. The physics presented is correct and the depth is adequate. References are to reliable sources.

**Very Good (3-4) points**: The scope is stated clearly stated. The report logically builds to it, and the reader can follow it. The (astro) physics is clearly explained and the is given sufficient pointers to dig deeper.

**Adequate (2-3) points**: The scope could have been clarified more explicitly but is in the end achieved. The (astro)physical aspects are explained in an appropriate way that the reader can follow. The reader is given a starting point for further investigation.

**Fair (0-2) points**: The presentation does not proceed orderly and it is hard to follow. The (astro)physical context is left implicit and not enough pointers for further investigation are provided. The text is hard to follow.


### Structure and formatting


**Exceptional (4-5) points**: Clear, logical, engaging, and easy to follow. All figures are useful, have captions, and are and well integrated with text. All references are provided and relevant.

**Very Good (3-4) points**: Figures are provided with useful caption and integrated in the text. All references are listed.

**Adequate (2-3) points**: The text is sufficiently clear. When present, figures are useful but could be better integrated, captions could be improved for clarity. References are provided but seem incomplete.

**Fair (0-2) points**: The text is hard to follow. Figures and/or captions are missing or not useful. References are incomplete or missing.
