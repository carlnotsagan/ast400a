**All presentations will be due to D2L by 12:30pm on Nov. 18, 2025**

Grading (8% of your Final Grade): 

Each presentation should be **10 minutes** long. 

We will have **5 minutes** after for the referees to ask their assigned questions.

## Rolling Deadline, Last Day is Dec 9. to Submit

Submit as a PDF your responses for 1. and 2. once you have been able to ask all of your questions and provide all of your feedback. 

1. You will be required to ask **three** different presenters _one question_ each and record the question you ask and summarize their response.
2. Additionally, for those **three** different presenters, you will be asked to provide a one to two paragraph feedback on the oral presentation. Consider reading this article about [feedback](https://www.markup.io/blog/presentation-feedback/). 


At present, these documents will only be shared with the TA and the Professor. You can request your feedback from your colleagues at any time over D2L or via email. 


_The goal is for us to learn ways we can improve communicating scientific information at an appropriate level. This classroom will serve as a means to develop these skills together. Please notify the Professor or TA of any comments or remarks outside of this scope that are deemed inappropriate as defined in the Course Syllabus._
